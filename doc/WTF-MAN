====
BASH:
====

"$x" - ALWAYS PUT DOUBLE QUOTES AROUND VARIABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
       All variables in bash are global !!!!!!!
"$*" - Combines all the arguments into single word, separating them with first character of IFS variable. If IFS is not set, space is used. If IFS is null, no separator is used!!!!!!!!! No args provided will result in one empty string being passed on!!! 
"$@" - Use this instead!!!!! Will retain arguments as-is, so no args provided will result in no args being passed on. This is in most cases what you want to use for passing on arguments.
    Google: "$@" is right almost everytime, and $* is wrong almost everytime.
"$#" - number of arguments
"$1" - first argument
"$0" - name of the script
$'\n' - string literal with escape seqences (there is a backslash before n)
    If you want IFS to be a new line (useful with for loop) you need to: IFS=$'\n' - the dollar forces substitution!!!!!
    Also if you want 'while read line; do...' to preserve leading spaces and tabs, you need to set IFS=""
$? - exit code of last command (0 - sucess)
Ctrl-Z, kill %% - kill looping bash script

test <expr> - same as [ <expression> ], returns zero exit status if true.
    -n - is string non empty, 
    -z - is string empty, 
    -a - and, 
    -o - or,
    = - strings are equal, 
    -nt - file newer than, 
    -ot - older then,
    -d - directory exists, 
    -e - file exists, 
    -f - is a regular file,
    -h - its a symbolic link, 
    -r - has read permission,
    -w - has write permission, 
    -x - has execute permission
[[ <expr> ]] - same as [, but without word splitting and filename expansion. And with additional operators: &&, ||, <, > (lexicographic less, more), and also regular expression matching.
=~ - regex comparison operator: [[ "$HOST" =~ ^user.* ]]
let <expr> - executes expression: let a="$b"+2

$(command) - same as `command`, but more readable!
eval <variable> - execute string as command
$RANDOM - 0 - 32767
input=`cat` - getting standard input
- - in place of a file name means standard in or out
set -o vi - set line editing to vi mode
pushd . - put current dir on stack
popd - pop dir from stack
cd - - go to last dir
source <script> - run script: for example source /etc/profile (same as . <command>)

export  PATH="$PATH:<dir>" - add new directory to path variable
read -p "Press [Enter] key to start backup..." - prompt for user input
var=${1:-"<default-value>"} - setting variable with default value if $1 is empty
getopts - parse parameters/arguments, builtin
getopt - GNU version is even better then getopts, not a builtin
while read line; do <commands>; done < <file> - read from file line by line
    -r - do not treat backslashes as escape characters
complete -F <completion-function> <command> - set completion function for command
complete -p <command> - print the completion function for command

IFS=$'\n\t' - remove space from the default Internal Field Separator

HISTORY:

sudo !! - run the last command as root 
<space>command - execute a command without saving it in the history

<command> &> /dev/null - redirect both standard and error output
<command> >&2 - write to stderr
<command> 2>&1 | less - add stderr to stdout and print it with less (useful for gcc)

ARRAYS AND LINES:

while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "... $line ..."
done <<< "$list" - reading line by line from variable, use IFS= to preserve spaces
${a[1]} - value of the second element of the array
for c in ${a[@]} - iterate over array
${varname:offset:length} - get substring: s="aeiou"; ${s:3:1} -> o

##  GIT  ##
###########

GIT MANTRA:
git init
git add <file> OR git add .
git status
git commit -am "<commit-message>"

CLONE FROM GITHUB:
git clone git@github.com:/<user>/<project> - download repo (later you keep refreshing with 'git pull origin master') -> You need SSH key. If you don't want, use https://github.com/<user>/<repo> for address.

GENERATE SSH KEY:
1. - Check for existing keys: cd ~/.ssh; ls -al
2. - Generate new key: ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
3. - Add your key to the ssh-agent: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
4. - Add your key to GitHub: copy contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and paste them into key field at Acount settings > SSH Keys > Add SSH key.

ADD TO GITHUB:
Create remote repository on website
git remote add origin git@github.com:/<user>/<project>.git
git pull origin master
git push origin master
after your first push, you can simply type:
git push
sometimes also: git push --set-upstream origin master

REMOTE:
git remote update - get info about state of remote
git remote show origin - print address of the origin
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<user>/<repo>.git - change the url of origin, ssh key needed
git remote set-url origin https://www.github.com/<user>/<repo>.git - same, but withouth key
git status -uno - check if everything up-to-date
git fetch; git checkout <branch> - checkout remote branch

TAGS:
git push --tags - push tags
git fetch --tags - pulling tags (automaticaly if on the same branch and there is a new commit?)

UNDO:
git reset --hard HEAD~1 - delete last commit and all of its changes
git reset HEAD~1 - delete last commit but keep your changes

ALSO USEFUL:
git checkout HEAD^ <file> - retrieve deleted file
git rm --cached <file> - untrack file without deleting it

git stash apply - apply the changes you stashed
git stash list - list all the stashes
git stash show -p stash@{0} - show the diff of most recent stash
git update-index --chmod=+x <file> - change files permissions
git config -l - print repos configuration settings
git config core.filemode false - ignores executable bit of the files

CHECKOUT:
git log > ../gitLog - first save log to file
git checkout <hash> - then checkout previous versions
git checkout head - return to head

GITHUB MD FORMAT:
![Alt text](/doc/basket-stats.png?raw=true "<Description>") - insert image

BISECT:
git bisect start
git bisect bad - tell git that current version is bad
git bisect good v25.0.2 - tell git the last good version you know about
now git will checkout a version in between, so you can check it and tell:
git bisect bad/good - this will continue until the commit that introduced the bug is found 
git bisect reset - exit bisect mode

TOOLS:
gitk - repo explorer
gitg - a bit nicer version
tig - text based repo explorer
gitstats - generates stats for git repo, outputs HTML

VIRTUAL BOX:
git config core.filemode false - Ignores the filemode changes made by the host system
